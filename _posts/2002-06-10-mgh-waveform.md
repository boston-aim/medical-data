summary: > 
    The Massachusetts General Hospital/Marquette Foundation (MGH/MF) Waveform Database is a comprehensive collection of electronic recordings of hemodynamic and electrocardiographic waveforms of stable and unstable patients in critical care units, operating rooms, and cardiac catheterization laboratories. It is the result of a collaboration between physicians, biomedical engineers and nurses at the Massachusetts General Hospital. The database consists of recordings from 250 patients and represents a broad spectrum of physiologic and pathophysiologic states. Individual recordings vary in length from 12 to 86 minutes, and in most cases are about an hour long.
